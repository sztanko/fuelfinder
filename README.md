### What to contribute with, if you can

- Promote it an all sites. This is a fully open and not-for-profit project and there will be no monetization attempts.
- If someone could reverse geocode the station addresses. We [have (lng, lat) pairs](https://github.com/sztanko/fuelfinder/blob/master/fuelfinder/public/stations.json), but we need street names and postcodes. This is a one-off job.
- Just make the site prettier. Without changing the framework libraries (bootstrap and scss), as it will take me more effort to maintain it.
- Add a client-side postcode lookup. Full list of postcodes is too big, but having the [postcodes without last two characters](https://github.com/sztanko/fuelfinder/blob/master/data/postcode_parts.csv) is enough (things like N4 4XX) precision, and it is just 11k lines.
- Promote, promote, promote
